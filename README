Project Overview:
  The Advising App serves as a digital assistant for students navigating their academic requirements. 

Key Features: 
  Authentication Flow: Includes a login and signup system for student access.
  Student Profile: A dashboard acting as the central hub for student information.
  Academic Tools: Visual class layouts to track progress.
  Advising Resources: Direct access to advisor information, and a comprehensive FAQ section.

Navigation Design:
  The app utilizes a NavHostFragment to manage screen transitions via nav.xml.
    1. StartingScreen: The entry point.
    2. Authentication: Users navigate to either LoginScreen or signupFragment.
    3. Core Dashboard: Successful authentication leads to the StudentProfile.
    4. Sub-Modules: From the profile, users can access ClassLayout, AdvisingInfo, FAQ_Resources, and how_To_Use.

The project follows the standard Android package structure, organized by feature.
